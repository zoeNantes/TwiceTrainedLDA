This code describes the experiments in my KES2019 paper &lt;Modular Ontology Learning with Topic Modelling over Core Ontology>. This version is the updated version after solving some errors in algortihms. 


If you are interested in this framework, it is recommanded to go through with the slide before starting to read this paper. The slide has the name as <ppt_kes_v4_official.pptx> under the category of <TwiceTrainedLDA>. The complete paper is not published yet, i will provide link once it is available in the network.
